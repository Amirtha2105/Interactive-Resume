# Interactive-Resume
Here, I've created an interactive resume, to showcase my skills and experience to the recruiters, or anyone interested in learning more about me. It goes beyond a traditional paper resume by including animations, interactive elements, and engaging visuals.

The execution of this project:

1. index.html -> The main content of the resume. I've attached a left side navigation menu for smooth scrolling to different sections, so that, by simply clicking it, the user can be able to scroll to the particular section. There's a header section that displays my name and role, along with LinkedIn link and Phone Number. By clicking the icon, the page gets directed to my LinkedIn Page and by clicking the phone icon, my phone number gets displayed. Apart from this, there are totally 6 sections which are:

    About Section -> that tells about myself, the areas here I'm interested to work with, my current qualification.
   
    Education Section -> My HSC score and the college name, where I'm pursuing my degree.
   
    Work Experience Section -> As I'm not a working professional yet, I've added my internship experience under this section.
   
    Skills Section -> I've listed the skills which I've acquired so far.
   
    Certiications Sections -> The certification courses which I have completed so far. I've provided the certificate links for viewing.
   
    Projects Section -> I've uploaded my project links to view, that opens in a new tab when clicked, along with small description.
   

4. styles.css -> By keeping responsive design in mind, I've styled this resume with professional blue and white color background, along with section headers animations, buttons and pop up details.
   For smooth scrolling, I've styled a navigation bar on the left side, throughout the page, so that the user need not scroll up again and again to land in a specific section.
   
6. app.js -> Showing and hiding pop details (here phone number) is taken care by JavaScript functionality.
